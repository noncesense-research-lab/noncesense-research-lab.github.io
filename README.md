## Contact / Invitation  
Please join us in #noncesense-research-lab on Freenode IRC. Sporadic communication occurs asynchronously, since our volunteer contributors are distributed across multiple continents. 

## Description of group

## Code Contributors 
IsthmusCrypto 
NeptuneResearch 
SerHack 
NeffmMllon 

## Projects 
### Monero Archival Project 
-  [Link to repo](https://github.com/mitchellpkt/monero_archival_project)
-  Customized Monero daemon 
-  Alt blocks and transactions 
-  Miner-reported timestamp nonsense
-  etc etc 

### Node discovery 
(in development) 

### Visualizations  
[insert awesome live visualizations] 

### Heuristic analysis tracking 
Ring signature anomalies related to size and timing 

### Selfish mining  
Description and link to [wiki article](https://github.com/Mitchellpkt/monero_archival_project/wiki/Selfish-mining-at-1636647) 

### Custom ring composition spoils Monero fungibility
Description and link to [wiki article](https://github.com/Mitchellpkt/monero_archival_project/wiki/Custom-ring-composition-spoils-Monero-fungibility)

### Fixed fee options 

Custom fees can damage privacy, and thus fungibility. The logic for fixed ring sizes transfers to fixed fee options.
